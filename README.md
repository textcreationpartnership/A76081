#####Body#####

1. THE INDEPENDENTS CHATECHISME.

    _ Quest.

    _ Quest. Were there many congregations, and Aſſemblies in the mother Church of Ieruſalem, which in our dialect are called Churches: or did the multitudes of beleevers in Ieruſalem make but one congregation, as the Independents ſuppoſe?

    _ Quest. Were not all thoſe hundred preachers and the many ten thouſands of believers ſo ſcattered abroad in the perſecution we read of, Act. 8. 1. 2. 3. That there was left no more believers in Ieruſalem then could meet in one congregation?

    _ Quest. Who Govern'd, ordered, and ruled this Church conſiſting of ſo many congregations and aſſemblies?

    _ Quest. Why do the Independent Brethren conclude every of their congregations a particular Church, depending upon no other Church; either for Government, Doctrine, or Manners, when the whole current of the Scripture doth ſo clearly expreſſe the Presbyterian Government Ordain'd by Chriſt in the mother Church of Jeruſalem muſt be a pattern unto all daughter Churches untill the end of the World.

    _ Quest. Who were commanded by Chriſt to preach the Goſpell, and to
 propound to all Nations the conditions upon which they were to be admitted into his Church; And who were to admit them?

    _ Quest. Did John Baptiſt or any of the primitive Apoſtles, and Miniſters ever call for a congregation to joyne with them in the admitting any member into the Church of Chriſt, or did they demand ſuch evidences and qualifications as the Independents do in the foregoing Queres?

    _ Quest. Where did the Apoſtles and primitive Presbyters delight to gather Churches?

    _ Queſt. What command have women in the Church either for preaching, or giving their voices, in the election
 or reprobation of members or officers?

    _ Quest. May diverſities of Religions be tolerated amongſt Chriſtians, or were they ever tolerated in the Old or New-Teſtament?

    _ Quest. Are the examples of the Patriarches, Prophets, and Apoſtles, who tolerated onely the true Religion; or the examples of Poland, Tranſylvania and Holland, to be followed, who tolerate all Religions?

    _ Queſt. What examples have we in Scripture for the ſuppreſſing of falſe Teachers, when they are openly diſcovered?

    _ Queſt. What eſteeme ought Chriſtians to have of thoſe Independent miniſters who inſtead of preaching the Word of God, in ſeaſon and out of
 ſeaſon to convert ſoules, preach their owne traditions and inventions, to deſtroy thoſe precious ſoules which other Godly Miniſters have converted?
